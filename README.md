This is a practice

The last time I collaborated on computer programming was in the 1990's, when I was working for WA State Dept of Natural Resources.
We had to make a bunch of similar changes to all the programs in the production environment,
because utilities were going to be removed from the common library.
We used a change management tool called Endevor.
